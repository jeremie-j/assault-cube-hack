### Intro
Dev an hack for assault cube game for educational purpose. The biggest part was to have a sort of framework, to dev hack as module, and add it to a main event loop that orcherstrate all of theses modules. 
For now it only display values of the game (not very impressive). But it will be extended with more and more modules
